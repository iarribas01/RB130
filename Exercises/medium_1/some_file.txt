Black and white film camera
Yellow sunglasses
Ashtray, swimming pool
Hot wax, jump off the roof
A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask, "Should we just keep driving?"
Maple syrup, coffee
Pancakes for two
Hash brown, egg yolk
I will always love you
A small concern with how the engine sounds
We held darkness in withheld clouds
I would ask, "Should we just keep driving?"
Should we just keep driving?
Passports in footwells
Kiss her and don't tells
Wine glass, puff pass, tea with cyborgs
Riot America, science and edibles
Life hacks going viral in the bathroom
Cocaine, side boob
Choke her with a sea view
Toothache, bad move
Just act normal
Moka pot Monday, it's all good
Hey, you
Should we just keep driving?
Should we just keep driving?
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Should we just keep driving?
